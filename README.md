# Mermaid JSDoc Viewer for GitHub

A browser (Chrome, Firefox & Safari) extension that finds [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams inside JSDoc comments while you browse source files on GitHub, and lets you preview them inline or open them in the full [Mermaid Live](https://mermaid.live) editor.

This is an independent, third-party project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by GitHub, Inc. or the Mermaid project — "GitHub" and "Mermaid" are used here only to describe what the extension works with.

No GitHub login required. No data collected. The only network requests are to `mermaid.ink` (for the inline preview image) and `mermaid.live` (when you click "Open in Mermaid Live" from the preview), and both happen only when you click — see [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md).

This is the "watch it inside GitHub" counterpart to [`mermaid-jsdoc-viewer`](https://github.com/g-ongenae/mermaid-jsdoc-viewer), a VS Code extension that does the same thing for diagrams you're editing locally.

---

## Why

Documenting architecture or flow logic with a ` ```mermaid ` block inside a JSDoc comment is a nice way to keep diagrams next to the code they describe — but GitHub only renders it as a fenced code block, not a diagram, whether you're reading the source or reviewing a diff. This extension adds a small badge next to the line number of every such block so you can preview or open the diagram without leaving the page or copy-pasting into an external tool.

---

## Features

- Scans `/** ... */` JSDoc comments in `.js`/`.jsx`/`.ts`/`.tsx` files, and plain fenced blocks in `.md`/`.markdown`/`.mdx` files, for ` ```mermaid ` code blocks — on blob (source file) pages, and on PR "Files changed", commit and compare diff pages
- Overlays a small 📊 badge next to the line number of each detected block; click it to open a zoomable/pannable preview (via [mermaid.ink](https://mermaid.ink)), which also links to the full mermaid.live editor
- On diff pages, if the diagram _itself_ was edited (not just surrounding code), the badge turns into 🔀 and clicking it shows the diagram **before and after side by side** — a red-tinted "Before" pane and a green-tinted "After" pane, each with its own "Open in Mermaid Live" link
- Preview supports scroll-to-zoom, drag-to-pan, double-click-to-reset, and a +/−/⟳ toolbar
- Works on GitHub's Turbo-driven navigation and lazy-loaded diffs — badges refresh automatically as you browse between files or scroll
- Light and dark mode support

Extension files: `manifest.{firefox,chrome}.json` · `content_script.js` · `viewer.css` · `pako_deflate.min.js` · `popup.{html,js}` · `icons/`

Permissions required: **none**. The content script is declared for `https://github.com/*` — GitHub navigates client-side (Turbo) without reloading, so the script must already be present when you reach a file, PR, commit or compare page; it stays idle on every other GitHub page. The popup asks the content script whether the current page is supported instead of reading the tab URL.

## Installation

- Install on Chrome: [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/github-mermaid-jsdoc-view/jhkfjpfhioaoopiapaipleecedggpimi)
- Install on Firefox: [Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/mermaid-jsdoc-viewer-for-githu/)

## Build

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 26+ for the one-time build step (`npm install`), which fetches and places `pako_deflate.min.js` — the extension won't load without it.

The extension ships two manifest files — pick the one for your browser:

| File                    | Browser               | Manifest version |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| `manifest.firefox.json` | Firefox               | V2               |
| `manifest.chrome.json`  | Chrome / Edge / Brave | V3               |
| `manifest.chrome.json`  | Safari (via Xcode)    | V3               |

Before loading, install dependencies and copy the right manifest to `manifest.json`:

```bash
npm install

# Firefox
cp manifest.firefox.json manifest.json

# Chrome / Edge / Brave
cp manifest.chrome.json manifest.json
```

### Firefox (temporary / development)

1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install`
3. `cp manifest.firefox.json manifest.json`
4. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`
5. Click **This Firefox** → **Load Temporary Add-on**
6. Select `manifest.json`

The extension is active until Firefox is closed. Repeat step 5–6 after each restart.

### Chrome / Edge / Brave

1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install`
3. `cp manifest.chrome.json manifest.json`
4. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
5. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle)
6. Click **Load unpacked** and select the repository folder

### Safari (macOS — requires Xcode)

Safari supports WebExtensions through Apple's converter tool. You need a Mac with **Xcode 12+** installed.

1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install`
3. `cp manifest.chrome.json manifest.json`
4. Run the converter:
   ```bash
   xcrun safari-web-extension-converter /path/to/github-mermaid-jsdoc-viewer --project-location ./safari-extension
   ```
5. Xcode opens automatically with the generated project — click **Build** (⌘B)
6. Open Safari and go to **Safari → Settings → Extensions**
7. Enable **Mermaid JSDoc Viewer for GitHub**

> Safari may show a warning that the extension is unsigned. To allow it, enable **Develop → Allow Unsigned Extensions** from the menu bar (this must be re-enabled after each Safari restart). The **Develop** menu can be turned on in **Safari → Settings → Advanced → Show features for web developers**.

### Permanent (self-distributed)

Run `npm install` first so `pako_deflate.min.js` and `PAKO_LICENSE` exist to include.

**Firefox:** Zip the extension folder contents and install via `about:addons` → gear icon → **Install Add-on From File**.

> For signing and distribution via addons.mozilla.org, see [Mozilla's extension signing docs](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/signing-and-distribution-overview/).

**Chrome:** Zip the folder and distribute the `.crx` file, or publish to the [Chrome Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish/).

## Usage

1. Open any `.js`/`.jsx`/`.ts`/`.tsx` or Markdown file on GitHub — either the "blob" view (e.g. `github.com/org/repo/blob/main/src/foo.ts`; for Markdown, the code view via `?plain=1`, since the rendered view already draws the diagrams) or a PR's "Files changed" tab, a commit diff or a compare view
2. Scroll to a JSDoc comment (or, in Markdown, any spot) containing a ` ```mermaid ` fenced code block
3. A small badge appears next to that line's line number — 📊 for a normal preview, or 🔀 if the diagram itself changed in this diff
4. Click it to open the preview:
   - 📊 opens a single zoomable/pannable diagram — scroll to zoom, drag to pan, double-click to reset, use the toolbar, or click **Open in Mermaid Live ↗** to edit it in the full editor
   - 🔀 opens a before/after comparison — a red-tinted "Before" pane and a green-tinted "After" pane side by side, each with its own "Open in Mermaid Live" link

---

## How it works

1. **Reads the source.** On blob pages, the react code view sometimes embeds the file's raw lines as JSON to hydrate itself (`script[data-target="react-app.embeddedData"]`, `payload['codeViewBlobLayoutRoute.StyledBlob'].rawLines`); large files leave this `null` and fetch content client-side instead, so there's a DOM fallback reading each `[data-testid="code-cell"][data-line-number]` element (or `id="LC<n>"` on older GitHub). On PR "Files changed", commit and compare diff pages, each file's diff is a `<table>` with one row per line, but GitHub ships three different markups: the React PR view (`tr.diff-line-row`, line numbers in `td.new-diff-line-number[data-diff-side][data-line-number]`, text in `.diff-text-inner`), the React commit view (same rows, but two plain `td.diff-line-number` cells — old, then new — with the number as text) and the classic server-rendered compare view (`table.diff-table`, two `td.blob-num[data-line-number]` cells, text in `td.blob-code`). All three are supported. Context rows carry both numbers, so the "old file" side can be reconstructed the same way for comparison.
2. **Finds mermaid blocks.** The same JSDoc-region + fence-tracking algorithm as [`mermaid-jsdoc-viewer`](https://github.com/g-ongenae/mermaid-jsdoc-viewer)'s VS Code extension, generalized to work over a (possibly gapped) list of `{lineNumber, text}` pairs — a diff's line numbers jump at hunk/file boundaries, and the parser treats any such gap as a reason to abandon whatever block it was mid-parsing rather than risk stitching unrelated lines together. A hunk that _starts_ on a ` * ...` comment-body line (GitHub's default three lines of context frequently begin right at the `* ```mermaid` fence, with the `/**` opener out of view) is assumed to already be inside a JSDoc comment. For Markdown files the JSDoc requirement is dropped and the fence is matched as a plain code block.
3. **Detects a changed diagram.** On diff pages, once a block is found on the "new" side, the content script checks whether its ` ```mermaid `/` ``` ` fence lines are context rows (i.e. existed before the change too). If so, it reconstructs the same line range from the "old" side and compares the two — a mismatch means the diagram itself changed, triggering the before/after badge and modal instead of a single preview.
4. **Encodes for mermaid.live/mermaid.ink.** Each diagram's source (old and/or new) is wrapped in the same JSON state object mermaid.live expects, deflated with [pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako), and base64url-encoded — producing a `pako:<...>` fragment usable by both `mermaid.live/edit#pako:...` and `mermaid.ink/svg/pako:...`.
5. **Overlays a badge.** Rather than inserting new elements into GitHub's own code/diff DOM (fragile, and any click inside that DOM can be intercepted by GitHub's own handlers), the content script computes the target line-number gutter element's `getBoundingClientRect()` and positions a small `position: fixed` badge next to it in a body-level overlay layer, recomputed on scroll/resize/rescan.

> **Note:** GitHub's DOM (and embedded payload shape) is not a public API and has changed shape at least once already during this extension's development. If GitHub ships a UI redesign, `getBlobLinesFromEmbeddedPayload`/`getBlobLinesFromDom`/`getBlobLineAnchor` (blob pages) and `getDiffFileContainers`/`getDiffRows`/`getRowLineNumber`/`getRowText`/`extractDiffOldCode` (diff pages) in `content_script.js` are the functions to patch — they're intentionally isolated for that purpose. The selectors currently in place were verified against real saved GitHub page HTML, not guessed from memory.

## Privacy

The extension collects nothing and has no server. The text of a mermaid diagram is sent to `mermaid.ink` (preview image) or `mermaid.live` (editor) **only when you click** its badge or link — nothing else on the page is transmitted. Full details in [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md).

---

## Publishing

### Building the store packages

Both stores receive a zip containing only the shipped files (no `node_modules`, `.git`, `scripts/`):

```bash
npm ci                                  # also builds pako_deflate.min.js + PAKO_LICENSE
cp manifest.firefox.json manifest.json  # or manifest.chrome.json
zip -r extension.zip manifest.json content_script.js viewer.css pako_deflate.min.js popup.html popup.js icons LICENSE PAKO_LICENSE
```

The `icons/*.png` files are pre-rendered from `icon.svg`; regenerate them (e.g. with [resvg](https://github.com/linebender/resvg) or Inkscape) if the SVG changes. Chrome does not accept SVG icons, so the manifests reference the PNGs.

---

## CI / CD

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) can publish to both stores on push to `main`. It gracefully skips any store whose secrets are not configured.

## Scope / limitations

- On PR "Files changed", commit and compare diff pages, only the diff's _new_ content is scanned (context + added lines). A mermaid block that spans outside the visible diff hunk (e.g. only part of it changed, with the rest collapsed into an unexpanded context gap) won't be detected until that context is expanded — the parser deliberately refuses to stitch across a line-number gap rather than risk a corrupted diagram. Both the ` ```mermaid ` opener and the closing ` ``` ` must be visible in the hunk; the `/**` line of the enclosing JSDoc comment need not be. In practice: if a commit only edits the diagram's body, the opener is usually the line just above the hunk — click GitHub's "expand up" arrow once and the badge appears.
- Only the unified diff view is supported, not the side-by-side split view.
- Only `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx` (JSDoc comments) and `.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdx` (plain fences) files are scanned.
- On a Markdown blob page GitHub renders the file (and its mermaid blocks) itself, so badges only appear in the code view (`?plain=1`). On diff pages they always appear — handy since GitHub's "rich diff" for Markdown renders the whole file rather than just the changed diagram.
